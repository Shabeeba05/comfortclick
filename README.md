## Project Description
Comfort Click is a unique solution designed to redefine the shopping experience in undergarment stores by introducing vending machine-style technology. Our project eliminates the awkwardness of discussing personal preferences by allowing customers to select undergarments through a user-friendly website. The vending system processes their choices and discreetly provides the selected product, ensuring privacy and convenience.

## The Problem Statement
Shopping for undergarments in physical stores can often be an uncomfortable experience due to the need to communicate personal preferences directly with sales personnel. Customers may feel hesitant or embarrassed, leading to a less satisfactory shopping experience.

## The Solution
Comfort Click introduces a **private and efficient** shopping method by combining a digital selection process with a vending machine-style pickup. Customers can browse, select, and purchase undergarments online or in-store using a **touch-free interface**. Their chosen products are then dispensed discreetly, eliminating the need for direct interactions.
